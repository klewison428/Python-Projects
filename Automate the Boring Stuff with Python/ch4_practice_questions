Practice Questions
Q:1. What is []?
	declaration of a list.  Empty list

Q:2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
	spam[2] = 'hello' 

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

Q:3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
	d

Q:4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
	d

Q:5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
	a, b

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

Q:6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
	1

Q:7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
	[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

Q:8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
	[3.14, 11, True]

Q:9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
	+, *

Q:10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
	Append adds to the end of the list.  Insert overwrites an existing value with a new value

Q:11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
	del, remove()

Q:12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
	A list and string value can be indexed, sliced and used in for loops.

Q:13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
	tuples are immutable

Q:14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
	numberOfEggs = (42)

Q:15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
	list(('cat', 'dog', 5)), tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])

Q:16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
	Reference - a reference is a value that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list.

Q:17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
	copy.copy will duplicate a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference.  copy.deepcopy() will copy inner lists as well.
